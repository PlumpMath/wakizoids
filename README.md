Wacky Asteroids

This is part of Game Off 2017

The theme is 'throwback'

Yeah, this is an asteroids game. Except... it's a throwback to a game I played over (mumble) years ago. The original version worked
on the BBC series of machines (BBC Master 128, maybe?) and was very colourful, full of particles and had blackholes!

I'm using godot (v2.1.4) as the engine

In other ways I'm a throwback myself. I'm approaching 60 (eek!) and I've been playing games on/off for a long time. I used to work
for Codemasters (http://www.codemasters.com/), so my name appears on some of the racing games. I'm no longer working in the games
industry but have a lot of friends who are still there.

Since I was an audio programmer I'm hoping to add generative music to this game.
